1) How would you rate (1-10) the difficulty level of the test (1 = really easy, 10 = impossible)?
    I would it give it a 7 difficulty level.

2) Was the time limit (7,5 hours) ok or too strict?
    The time limit would probably be OK for an experienced fullstack developer.
    As for me, it took me about 20 hours to complete the project.
    A quite substantial amount of time was spent on research, and learning on how to implement frontend functionalities.

3) Other feedback about the test?
    Not so much of a feedback, but a question: does Elisa work with the technologies chosen for this project
    (Jersey, Grizzly, spring-jdbc)?
    As a final word, I particularly liked this project, for it has exposed me to technologies I wasn't too familiar with.
